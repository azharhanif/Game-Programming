Specific to the Game Programming course:
Show the steps, to download my project files from the public git hub folder of the teacher's repository to my computer, complete the lab/assignment, and then upload the folder to my own repository

Let’s break it into clear, step-by-step instructions so you can:
Download (clone) your teacher’s repository
Work on the assignment locally
Upload (push) your finished work to your own repository

🔹 Step 1: Download Teacher’s Repository
Go to your teacher’s GitHub repository page.
Click the green “Code” button → copy the HTTPS link (it looks like https://github.com/teachername/repository.git).
On your computer, open a terminal (or Git Bash).
Navigate to the folder where you want to save the project:
cd Documents/School/Assignments
Clone the teacher’s repository:
git clone https://github.com/teachername/repository.git
This will download the entire repo into a new folder.

🔹 Step 2: Work on the Assignment
Enter the project folder:
cd repository
Open the folder in your code editor (e.g., Greenfoot).
Make your changes and complete the assignment.
Save all files. Upload in Omnivox Lab/Assignment section as instructed by the teacher

🔹 Step 3: Create Your Own Repository on GitHub
Go to GitHub.
Click “New” → create a repository (give it a name like my-assignment-1).
Don’t initialize with README (to avoid conflicts).
Copy the repository URL (looks like https://github.com/yourname/my-assignment-1.git).

🔹 Step 4: Push Your Work to Your Repository
In the terminal, inside your project folder, remove the link to the teacher’s repo:
git remote remove origin
Add your own repository as the new “origin”:
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourname/my-assignment-1.git
Stage all changes:
git add .
Commit your work:
git commit -m "Completed assignment 1"
Push to your GitHub:
git push -u origin main
(If your branch is called master, replace main with master.)

Now your assignment is uploaded to your own GitHub repository, separate from the teacher’s!
