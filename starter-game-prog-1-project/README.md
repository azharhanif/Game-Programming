- Team size: 3 or 4 students per team

### B. Hard Specifications
The Game Project must provide at least 1 minute of engaging gameplay and the following elements:
- Splash screen (3 seconds) with Game Programming 1 course title, team members, and the Vanier Logo
- Start screen with the name of your game
- Implementation of at least 2 core mechanics

2. **Game Design Document**  
   Due: October 17 (20 points)
3. **Game Project Implementation**  
   Due: November 28 (40 points)
4. **Project Presentation + PPT Slides**  
   Due: December 3 & 5 (30 points)

**Total: /100**

### 1. Project Proposal + Team members
The game proposal summarizes the game you are about to make. It describes the core mechanics, the levels, and the fun factor of the game. It should be a maximum of 2 pages.
- Team Project members
- Title, tagline, genre, target audience, goal
- Major Mechanics Descriptions
- Draft version of the world (or level) and description of the settings

### 2. Game Design Document
The game design document should be approximately 10 pages. It must contain the following:
- **Executive summary (1 page max)**: Describe what the game is, including a description of the world, characters, enemies, main game mechanics, and what needs to be done to beat the game.
- **User Interface Mock-up(s)**: Provide a visual representation of the game, levels, user interface, and flow between screens. These can be hand-drawn or a collage from online images.
- **Controls**: Describe how the game mechanics map to controller inputs.
- **Tasks and Schedule breakdown**: List the tasks required to implement the game, assign team members responsible for each task, and establish deadlines.

### 3. Game Project Implementation
- Your game code (implementation) should comply with the hard specifications mentioned above.
- Your Greenfoot team project should be submitted by the deadline to allow the instructor to check it before the presentation.

### 4. Project Presentation (10 minutes per team maximum)
- Create and present a PowerPoint Presentation (maximum 10 slides)
  - Show the main sections of your Game Design Document (up-to-date)
